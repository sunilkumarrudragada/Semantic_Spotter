        "\n",
        "Insurance policy documents are often long, complex, and filled with technical jargon that makes it challenging for customers and agents to find specific information such as claim limits, exclusions, coverage details, and waiting periods. Traditional keyword-based searches are insufficient, as they fail to capture the contextual meaning of user queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this problem, **IntelliPolicy** aims to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that can accurately answer natural language questions from multiple insurance policy documents. The system retrieves the most relevant sections from the documents and generates concise, context-aware responses using a Large Language Model (LLM).\n",

        "\n",

        "The overall workflow consists of the following major stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Document Loading**  \n",
        "   - Load insurance policy PDFs using LangChain’s `PyPDFLoader`.  \n",
        "   - Each document is parsed into structured text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Text Splitting**  \n",
        "   - The extracted text is divided into smaller, overlapping chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.  \n",
        "   - This ensures optimal context preservation and embedding quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Embedding Generation**  \n",
        "   - Each text chunk is transformed into a high-dimensional vector representation using `OpenAIEmbeddings`.  \n",
        "   - These embeddings help capture semantic meaning for efficient retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Vector Store Creation**  \n",
        "   - All embeddings are stored in a vector database (like **ChromaDB**) for fast and accurate similarity search.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Retriever Setup**  \n",
        "   - The retriever fetches the top relevant chunks for a given query based on vector similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **LLM Integration (RAG Pipeline)**  \n",
        "   - The retrieved context is passed to the LLM (`ChatOpenAI`) to generate a concise and context-aware answer.  \n",
        "   - LangChain’s `RetrievalQA` chain is used to connect the retriever with the LLM.\n",

        "The IntelliPolicy RAG system successfully retrieves and summarizes key information from insurance policy documents using LangChain.  \n",
        "It enables users to query complex policy terms in natural language and receive accurate, context-based answers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Learnings\n",
        "- Gained hands-on experience with RAG architecture.\n",
        "- Implemented embeddings, vector stores, and retrievers using LangChain.\n",
        "- Built an interpretable and modular pipeline for document-based Q&A.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Future Enhancements\n",
        "\n",
        "- Integrate multiple policy documents with metadata-based retrieval (e.g., by insurer or policy type).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Add a Streamlit or Gradio-based web interface for end users.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Implement hybrid retrieval (semantic + keyword search) for better accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Include summarization and confidence scoring in the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Extend the system into a conversational assistant using LangChain’s memory for multi-turn Q&A.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Explore using local open-source LLMs (like Llama 3 or Mistral) for cost optimization.\n"
